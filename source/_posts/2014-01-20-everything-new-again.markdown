After a few years without writing articles and without updating my personal website, I decided to work to revive this project. 

I want to use this space to comment about software development and everything else that might interest me. 

## Choosing new platform 

For this project, I wanted a tool that would allow me to have a blog with minimal effort and allowing me to use [markdown](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to write posts. 

Looking possibilities I met the [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) a really nice framework for [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), which is a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/) tool that enables you to generate static templates from websites and markdowns. 

I am enjoying the experience because beyond the speed of deployment of the blog, create [markdown](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) posts is spectacular. 

And you, know [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)? What is your opinion about it?
